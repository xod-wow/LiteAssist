<!--
  - Since 2.0 we aren't allowed to call the assist functions ourselves,
  - so we have to proxy them via UI button elements using the
  - SecureActionButton template and bind keys to imitate clicking it
  - with the mouse to fire off the action.  Clumsy, but that's Blizzard
  - for you.
 -->

<!--
  - This first button does the actual assisting, bound to LITEASSIST_DO.
  -
  - It starts out assisting your target (normal behaviour for the assist
  - key), but the learn button below will change the macro to assiste
  - the learnt named unit.
  -
  - The configuration of that is done in the OnLoad handler.

	<AbsDimension x="2" y="2" />

<!--
  - These two buttons learn a new assist unit (MA, whatever).
  -
  - Since all we're doing is changing a macro and we aren't doing
  - it in combat, we don't actually need these buttons.  But, I'm
  - leaving it done this way to allow easier implementing of something
  - clever if Blizzard allow more things to be done with the 
  - SecureActionButtons.
  -
  - The preclick handler here just changes the macrotext of the
  - previous button and pops up a message about what it did.
  -
  - We could do this with one button and different actions for left-click
  - and right-click, but it'd be a lot less clear.  Not worth it
  - just to save one button.
